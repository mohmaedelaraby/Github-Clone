For Setting Up & Running the Project : -

1 Clone this git link : https://github.com/mohmaedelaraby/Formula-One.git
2 npm install
3 npm run dev 
the project will run locally 

if You want to test use  ' npm run test '

My technical approach and architectural decisions :- 

1 setup the project using React + vite (typescript)
2 use Modular architecture because i think it will help me if i tried to large up scale my project
3 made UI for the project using html ,css and use MUI and search for suitable font 
4 build in service and hooks to fetch data and integrate it with the ui using (React query) and jandle loading and errors 
5 build 404 page and not found in shared module
6 install jest and build configuration for the project for unit testing
7 write simple test cases to test each module alone
9 do bouns point search in drivers table using debounce 
10 deploy the project on firebase
